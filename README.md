## Story

Your company has a problem with users of your HTTP API. Some of them have tried to hack your system, but fortunately your security department has stopped them in time. 
In effect you were given a list of attackers IP's in order to block them. Security team did good job, but you need to take into account that the list that they gave 
you will grow in the future since there are a lot of malicious hackers in the Internet.

Based on the input from the security team you have decided to create some kind of firewall. Think about possible solutions under the following assumptions:

- there is a predefined list of IP's that should be blocked
- you would like to add and remove IP's from black list without restarting the application
- firewall is a small part of whole application - focus on it and not on the whole system.

What's more, one of the previous developers has been already trying to implement the firewall but he has not finished. Take a look at his implementation.
Maybe you will find something useful.
